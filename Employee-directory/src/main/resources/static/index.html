<!--
  - `http-equiv="refresh"`: Specifies the type of header the meta tag simulates. In this case, it simulates an HTTP refresh header.
  - `content="0; URL='employees/list'"`: The content attribute details the specifics of the refresh.
    - `0`: The number before the semicolon indicates the delay in seconds before the redirection takes place. A value of 0 causes the redirection to happen immediately.
    - `URL='employees/list'`: Specifies the URL to which the redirection will occur. In this case, it redirects to 'employees/list', which could be a relative path to the current domain.
